Huijun Gao, Ming Yi, Jinyong Yu, Fengyu Guo. “A Character-Segmentation Cascade Binary Classifier Based
Adaptive Detection Approach for Automobile Dashboard” (Patent Pending)
# [](#header-2)Research Experience
## [](#header-2)[Design an automobile surround view system](another-page).
*   Calculated internal and external parameters of fisheye cameras and calibrated cameras
*  Design image fusion and stitching algorithm, generate top view image of automobile.
## [](#header-2)[Design two detection algorithms for automobile dashboard detection vision System](meterdetection).
*   Proposed a clustering-based approach and a character segmentation-based approach to detect dashboard
*   Both algorithms had more accurate detection results than traditional meter detection algorithm. The latter algorithm is an adaptive approach for detecting different types of dashboard
*  This detection system reduced the detection time from 30 minutes (by labor) to 30 seconds per dashboard
*  The adaptive approach has applied for a national patent and is planning to apply for a US patent
## [](#header-2)[Intelligent diagnosis of lung nodules](another-page).
* Preprocessed lung CT data and extracted the mask of the lung region in the CT image
* Used U-Net to study the characteristics of lung nodules and segmented test images
* Extracted the 3D connected domain and obtained 3D data of all the suspected lung nodules
* Set up a 3D-CNN classification network. The 3-D data was fed to the classification network for training. Used
the trained network to classify the test set and the layer outputted the probability of this region
## [](#header-2)[Design modified octree algorithm for embedded system display](Octree).
* Proposed modified octree quantization method combined with visual saliency
* Compared with Microsoft Paint 256 color algorithm and traditional octree algorithm, the images produced by
our algorithm had more layers and details
* This algorithm is applying for a national patent
## [](#header-2)[Design algorithm for chip positioning and defect inspection in SMT](Octree).
*  Proposed a template-matching based method to obtain chip’s accurate position
*  This algorithm satisfies real-time requirement of Surmount Surface Technology (SMT)
## [](#header-2)[Design an embedded surveillance system](another-page).
*  Ported U-boot, trimmed and ported Linux kernel and built root file system on ARM11(S3C6410)
*  Designed camera Linux driver and temperature sensor driver
*  Data transmission was based on TCP/IP protocol. Designed UI interface by QT
